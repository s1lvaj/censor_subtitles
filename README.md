# Censoring subtitles

Enhance your language learning experience by immersing yourself in content while actively engaging with the language.

This project features a small Python script that modifies movie subtitles, helping learners by providing uncensored subtitles alongside censored ones. This dual approach encourages learners to derive meaning from the context of each scene, making the learning process easier.

## How to Use

To use this script, make sure you have python installed and then follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    First, clone the repository to your local machine by running:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/s1lvaj/censor_subtitles.git
    ```

2. **Download the Repository (Optional)**:

    Alternatively, you can download the repository directly without using Git. Simply append `/zipball/master` to the end of the URL:

    ```bash
    https://github.com/s1lvaj/censor_subtitles/zipball/master
    ```

3. **Run the Script**:

    Navigate to the project directory and run the script, following its instructions in order to process your subtitles.
